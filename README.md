# Notes & Process

### Sketching
For this assignment I sketch a simple website were I can interact with some of the content of the Current Weather api. Although this API provides little information I decided to use this one, undestanding that accesing the API it was going to be a challenge. 
For this sketch I designed an interface where the user can click a button to change the value from the Celsius to Fahrenheit. The information is displayed in the same area. The user is also able to see sother data such as Precipitation, Date, day or night, and how are the conditions of the day (cloudy, sunny, etc.).

### Accesing and API
Using the developer site of accuweather was very accesible. 
The most challenging part was to be able to see the data from console in my localhost. I used the async function to access the results. However, I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out how to acces each part of the result, because it wasn't clear to me that I was getting an array. After that, I was able to access each part of the array.

### async function and fetch()
I'm still not completly sure how tu use this function and in what conditions makes sense to use it. However, to access the API data, I created another async function to be able to manipulate it. I think that to be able to manipulate data from the API this has to happen in a async function. I started this exercise with the example code shown on class.

### getElement
I used document.getElementById("localDate").innerHTML when I want to use the data in the html file.

### API data to dynamically change the DOM - Interactive Button
Creating the buttons was the other challenging part of this project. I wasn't sure how to make a button change a value from the file.js.

I managed this was using:

In file.js
<code>document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function changeTemp(){...}</code>
the .addEventListener help me to open a communication with the html elemnts.

In index.html
<code><button><input type="button" id="myBtn" value="Celsius"></button></code>
Using "value" in the html I was able to manipulate the results as a booloean statement.

### new Date();
To get the local date a used a built-in function from js that gives you yout current time. I decided to use this function instead the time from the API because this one is updated each time that the user refresh the website. Instead the one in the API update as frequent as the API data update. Wich means that sometimes minutes pass and the time hasn't changed.

### html and css
The website has an responsive design where the information of precipitation, time and day, changes from a row into a column. Because I have more dynamic things to go around in the code, I had more difficulties creating and styling the website. However at the end I decided with a simple design approach to be able focus on the functionality. 

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here ## Process & Documentation -->

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
This project was very challenging being the first time that I attempted to use an API. The most challenging processes were: 
1. Creating an interactive button
2. Accesing the API data
3. Understanding how to use: .addEventListener | getElementById | async function | fetch

<!-- Any questions you have -->
## Questions
1. I am not sure if I had the best approach to create a dynamic button.
2. How to add the degree symbol (Â°)? adding this to the information returned by the API.
