## Design Process

In this design I had different challenges to acomplish during this process assignment. 

For my proposal a intended to: 

* Get multiple options for voting
* Responsive design
* Persisten data
* Visualize in a graph the amount of votes per animal (P5 sketch) 
* Open a window to confirm vote

Although I didn't not completed all of my original goals (open a new window to confirm the vote), it was good for my process to make a clear path of priorities that I want to complete and what options did I have to get the main concept of the design. 

## Sketches

In this experience sketchis was essential to understand form the beggining what were my design goal. this helps me to have a more deterministic approach when I was making the frontend of the website.

**Sketching**

My first concept was to make a window that open to let the user confirm the vote that its casting. Because some other parts of the assigment took me more time that espected to make it work. I wasn't able to put this version in practice.

**Reiterate the Wireframes**

However, the essence of that interaction is to confirm the vote. That is why i desided to just includ a messaje quen a person votet for a specific animal. The message said the animal that the user voted.

**Style Guide**
The process of making my Style Guide helped me to visualize with anticipation, how I want to separe my sections to make it responsive. This give me clarity in the CSS development. Although that I applied also other measuramentes, I mostly used responsive width and height for my design.

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here ## Process & Documentation -->

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
Because in general there is a lot of information to absorbe and apply during this process, I have to say that i encounter difficulties during each step of the development process. the hard part is not only ignore the reason why something didnt work, but also try to understant how sometimes you make it work. I think that that is the main reason that I feel that some challenges or struggles were to obscure to understand. ðŸ™ƒ

However, I noticed that things that were a challenge 3 weeks ago, this last time it wasn't. That give me hope. 

### In this assigment the things that were more challenging were: 

**Accesing file in outside folders**
**P5 Integrated in the website**
adding a P5 canvas in a specific location, and make interactve motion using the voting counts
**Creating a new database using Nedb**
**Using Mongo DB**
**Deployment on Glitch**
**Trying Heroku**

<!-- Any questions you have -->

## Next steps
* make sure that the user can vote one time. What are the options?
