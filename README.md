<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
Because in general there is a lot of information to absorbe and apply during this process, I have to say that i encounter difficulties during each step of the development process. the hard part is not only ignore the reason why something didnt work, but also try to understant how sometimes you make it work. I think that that is the main reason that I feel that some challenges or struggles were to obscure to understand. ðŸ™ƒ
However, I noticed that things that were a challenge 3 weeks ago, this last time it wasn't. That give me hope. 
# In this assigment the things that were more challenging were: 
**Accesing file in outside folders**
**P5 Integrated in the website**
adding a P5 canvas in a specific location, and make interactve motion using the voting counts
**Creating a new database using Nedb**
**Using Mongo DB**
**Deployment on Glitch**
**Trying Heroku**

<!-- Any questions you have -->

## Next steps
* make sure that the user can vote one time. What are the options?
